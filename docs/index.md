## Data Science in Julia for Hackers

* First chapter: Science, technology, models and epistemology. 

* [Second chapter](https://datasciencejuliahackers.com/02_julia_intro.jl.html): 
 Here we introduce the Julia programming language, showing examples of code and some first steps. 

* [Third chapter](https://datasciencejuliahackers.com/03_probability_intro.jl.html): An introduction to probability, probability distributions and Bayes' interpretation. 

* [Fourth chapter](https://datasciencejuliahackers.com/04_naive_bayes.jl.html): using a Naive-Bayes approach we construct a simple spam email filter.

* [Fifth chapter](https://datasciencejuliahackers.com/05_prob_prog_intro.jl.html): An introduction to Probabilistic Programming and some simple examples using the Turing.jl package.

* [Sixth chapter](https://datasciencejuliahackers.com/06_gravity.jl.html): we estimate the gravity of Mars to compute the escape velocity, throwing stones and taking very simple measurements from it.

* [Seventh chapter](https://datasciencejuliahackers.com/07_football_simulation.jl.html): we use a hierarchical bayesian model to estimate latent variables that describe Premier LeagueÂ´s football teams.

* [Eighth chapter](https://datasciencejuliahackers.com/08_basketball_shots.jl.html): we analyze how the scoring probability is affected by some variables, such as the distance from the hoop and the angle of shooting.

* [Nineth chapter](https://datasciencejuliahackers.com/09_optimal_pricing.jl.html): we solve a problem of optimal pricing optimization using a bayesian point of view.

* [Tenth chapter](https://datasciencejuliahackers.com/10_bees_vs_wasps.jl.html): in this chapter we give an overview of Machine Learning and we implement a simple convolutional neural network to solve a bees vs. wasps classification.

* [Eleventh chapter](https://datasciencejuliahackers.com/11_ultima_online.jl.html): we explain the Ultima Online Catastrophe using differential equations to build a population dynamics model.

* [Twelfth chapter](https://datasciencejuliahackers.com/12_ultima_continued.jl.html): A continuation of the Ultima Online Catastrophe, introducing the Universal Differential Equations to recover missing parts of scientific models.

* [Thirteenth chapter](https://datasciencejuliahackers.com/13_time_series.jl.html): we see the basics for time series analysis, focusing on the exponential smoothing method.
