>*"We have a habit in writing articles published in scientific journals to make the work as finished as possible, to cover up all the tracks, to not worry about the blind alleys or describe how you had the wrong idea first, and so on"*
**Richard Feynman**


One of the first things to note about this book is that it is not an academic textbook. We are not academics, we don't have a PhD, and much less we are experts in the topics we are going to discuss. 
We are passionate, amateur enthusiasts, with multidisciplinary backgrounds, which range from Engineering, Informatics, Physics and Economy, that converged their approaches in this book. 
So what type of book is this, then? It lies somewhere in between a methodological recipe and a theoretical intensive textbook. What we want to deliver in this book is a mathematical and computational methodology to face concrete Data Science problems, and to end with the theory/practice dilemma. The two approaches are important and their relationship is complex. Considering them as a whole can take us much farther. These pages may offer the theorist a way to think about problematic situations in a more down to earth manner, and to the practitioner, stimulation to go beyond the mere application of programming libraries and tools.

The situations presented in the book are diverse, reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of Data Science. The solutions, however don't try to be beautiful or perfect. We know that the path to resolving real-life problems is muddy, that sometimes you might feel lost and that your ideas may change as you try to find the solution, but we encourage to embrace this non-elegant features and accept the sharp corners in this learning-through-solving journey. Suggestions, criticism and feedback are very appreciated, this book is alive and will evolve as a consequence of it's environment response. 

Although this book isn't intended to have obscure, overly-technical or academic definitions that may scare the reader, people with a little of programming knowledge, basic understanding of Calculus and some modelling intuition will get the most out of these pages. Namely, familiarity with a high-level language like Python, taking derivatives and some function analysis. 
All chapters include the code for the reader to play, explore and implement the solutions on their own. Moreover, links to notebooks with the worked solutions are available. 

Why "Hackers"?
Si los hackers son personas con espíritus innovadores y con un gran conocimiento en tecnología (Hacking: Art of Exploitation), entonces por qué el libro es para Hackers? acaso el área de Data Science se puede considerar una nueva tecnología, con sus vulnerabilidades y exploits? qué ofrece el libro para este perfil de personas?


Why Julia?
