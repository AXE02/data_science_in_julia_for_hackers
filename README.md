## Practical Bayes with Julia

[First chapter](https://lambdaclass.com/practical_bayes_with_julia/introduction/intro_julia_and_bayes.jl.html):
 Here we introduce the Julia programming language, showing examples of code and some first steps. Then we talk about histograms, probability distributions and  finally about the Bayesian interpretation of probability.

[Second chapter](https://lambdaclass.com/practical_bayes_with_julia/introduction/prob_prog.jl.html): An introduction to Probabilistic Programming, and some simple examples in Turing and Soss.

[Third chapter](https://lambdaclass.com/practical_bayes_with_julia/naive_bayes/spam_filter.jl.html), using a Naive-Bayes approach we construct a simple spam email filter.

[Fourth chapter](https://lambdaclass.com/practical_bayes_with_julia/gravity_exercise/gravity_exercise.jl.html), we estimate the gravity of Mars to compute the escape velocity, throwing stones and taking very simple measurements from it.

[Fifth chapter](https://lambdaclass.com/practical_bayes_with_julia/football_analysis/football-analysis-chapter.jl.html), we use a hierarchical bayesian model to estimate latent variables that describe Premier LeagueÂ´s football teams.

[Sixth chapter](https://lambdaclass.com/practical_bayes_with_julia/basketball_scoring/basketball_shots.jl.html), we analyze how the scoring probability is affected by some variables, such as the distance from the hoop and the angle of shooting.

[Seventh chapter](https://lambdaclass.com/practical_bayes_with_julia/optimal_pricing/optimal-pricing-chapter.jl.html), we solve a problem of optimal pricing optimization using a bayesian point of view.

[Eighth chapter](https://lambdaclass.com/practical_bayes_with_julia/ultima_online_chapter/ultima_online_chapter.jl.html), we explain the Ultima Online Catastrophe using differential equations to build a population dynamics model.
