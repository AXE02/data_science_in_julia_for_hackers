## An introduction to Bayes

[First chapter](https://lambdaclass.com/bayes_book_public/introduction/intro.jl.html): an introduction to Julia and Bayes.
 Here we talk about the Julia programming language, showing examples of code and some first steps. Then we talk about distributions, histograms and we solve the well known problem of flipping a coin using a bayesian framework.

[Second chapter](https://lambdaclass.com/bayes_book_public/optimal_pricing/optimal-pricing-chapter.jl.html), we solve a problem of optimal pricing optimization using a bayesian point of view.
