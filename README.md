## Practical Bayes with Julia

[First chapter](https://lambdaclass.com/practical_bayes_with_julia/introduction/intro_julia_and_bayes.jl.html):
 Here we introduce the Julia programming language, showing examples of code and some first steps. Then we talk about histograms, probability distributions and  finally about the Bayesian interpretation of probability.

[Second chapter](https://lambdaclass.com/practical_bayes_with_julia/introduction/prob_prog.jl.html): An introduction to Probabilistic Programming, and some simple examples in Turing and Soss.

[Third chapter](https://lambdaclass.com/practical_bayes_with_julia/optimal_pricing/optimal-pricing-chapter.jl.html), we solve a problem of optimal pricing optimization using a bayesian point of view.

[Fourth chapter](https://lambdaclass.com/practical_bayes_with_julia/gravity_exercise/gravity_exercise.jl.html), we estimate the gravity of Mars to compute the escape velocity, throwing stones and taking very simple measurements from it.

[Fifth chapter](https://lambdaclass.com/practical_bayes_with_julia/football_analysis/football-analysis-chapter.jl.html), we use a hierarchical bayesian model to estimate latent variables that describes Premier LeagueÂ´s football teams.
