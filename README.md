## Practical Machine Learning and Bayes with Julia

* [First chapter](https://lambdaclass.com/machine_learning_bayesianism_with_julia/julia_introduction/julia_intro.jl.html): 
 Here we introduce the Julia programming language, showing examples of code and some first steps. 

* Second chapter: Science, technology, models and epistemology. 

* [Third chapter](https://lambdaclass.com/machine_learning_bayesianism_with_julia/probability_introduction/prob_intro.jl.html): An introduction to probability, probability distributions and Bayes' interpretation. 

* [Fourth chapter](https://lambdaclass.com/machine_learning_bayesianism_with_julia/naive_bayes/spam_filter.jl.html): using a Naive-Bayes approach we construct a simple spam email filter.

* [Fifth chapter](https://lambdaclass.com/machine_learning_bayesianism_with_julia/prob_prog_intro/prob_prog.jl.html): An introduction to Probabilistic Programming and some simple examples using the Turing.jl package.

* [Sixth chapter](https://lambdaclass.com/machine_learning_bayesianism_with_julia/gravity_exercise/gravity_exercise.jl.html): we estimate the gravity of Mars to compute the escape velocity, throwing stones and taking very simple measurements from it.

* [Seventh chapter](https://lambdaclass.com/machine_learning_bayesianism_with_julia/football_analysis/football-analysis-chapter.jl.html): we use a hierarchical bayesian model to estimate latent variables that describe Premier LeagueÂ´s football teams.

* [Eighth chapter](https://lambdaclass.com/machine_learning_bayesianism_with_julia/basketball_scoring/basketball_shots.jl.html): we analyze how the scoring probability is affected by some variables, such as the distance from the hoop and the angle of shooting.

* [Nineth chapter](https://lambdaclass.com/machine_learning_bayesianism_with_julia/optimal_pricing/optimal-pricing-chapter.jl.html): we solve a problem of optimal pricing optimization using a bayesian point of view.

* [Tenth chapter](https://lambdaclass.com/machine_learning_bayesianism_with_julia/bees_vs_wasps/wasp_detector.jl.html): in this chapter we give an overview of Machine Learning and we implement a simple convolutional neural network to solve a bees vs. wasps classification.

* [Eleventh chapter](https://lambdaclass.com/machine_learning_bayesianism_with_julia/ultima_online_chapter/ultima_online_chapter.jl.html): we explain the Ultima Online Catastrophe using differential equations to build a population dynamics model.

* Twelfth chapter: A continuation of the Ultima Online Catastrophe, and an introduction to universal ODEs.

* [Thirteenth chapter](https://lambdaclass.com/machine_learning_bayesianism_with_julia/time_series/time_series_chapter.jl.html): we see the basics for time series analysis, focusing on the exponential smoothing method.
